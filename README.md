# Intro
I always wanted a tool where I can just put in a price in either USD or YEN and get a one stop shop to see what the conversion is and the Japanese form of the number is so I can actually communicate that number to native Japanese speakers. Loosely based off of the work of https://github.com/Greatdane/Convert-Numbers-to-Japanese. Improved and expanded to convert VERY VERY large numbers.
